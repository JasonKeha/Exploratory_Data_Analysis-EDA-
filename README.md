# Exploratory_Data_Analysis-EDA-
This is a repository showcasing my most important Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects.

Specifically in this repository I show how I am:

* Proficient in identifying and handling missing values and other data quality issues.
* Skilled in creating visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, correlation plots) to understand the distribution and relationships of variables.
* Experienced in calculating and interpreting summary statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) for numerical variables.
* Capable of analyzing categorical variables and their distributions.
* Knowledgeable in performing feature engineering to create new variables or transform existing ones.
* Competent in identifying and analyzing correlations between variables.
* Able to communicate insights and findings effectively through visualizations and/or reports.
* Skilled in using EDA to inform the selection and implementation of machine learning algorithms.

And when it comes to python libraries I show my ability in the following:
* Pandas: a library for data manipulation and analysis.
* Matplotlib: a library for creating visualizations, such as line charts, scatter plots, and histograms.
* Seaborn: a library for creating more advanced and aesthetically pleasing visualizations, such as heatmaps and pair plots.
* Plotly: a library for creating interactive visualizations, such as maps and 3D plots.
